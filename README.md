# bachelorthesis: automated wildfire plume detection algorithm
This repository contains an algorithm to to detect wildifires, using TROPOMI (http://www.tropomi.eu/) observations on the atmospheric carbon monoxide concentration.

To initizalize the algorithm and for further references, consult the initialize_algorithm.py script.
